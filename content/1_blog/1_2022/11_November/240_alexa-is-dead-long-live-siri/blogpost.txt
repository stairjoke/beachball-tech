> For any task X on a new platform, if doing X is not far easier than just doing X on your phone, X is never going to be a reason to use that new platform. (John Gruber)

He's absolutely right here, why would I use a new device to do the same thing in a less convenient way?

He's absolutely right here, why would I use a new device to do the same thing in a less convenient way? I don't understand the value proposition of Alexa: Buy this glorified light switch you need to talk to to make it turn the lights on, from a company you don't really trust a lot, and let it listen to you 24/7, we'll figure out what else it is good for later. No thanks.

## On the HomePod
I've been using the HomePod (the big one) since 2018, and I love and hate it every day. It is super convenient *while* it works, but you need to restart it every other week to keep it from dying on you. If Apple committed to making a line of HiFi smart speakers (no, the HomePod Mini does not count as HiFi), and made a new one that was reliable, I might even consider upgrading. But a lot of trust was burned by Apple already with the 2018 model. To gain that back, I'm not sure what they'd have to do.
